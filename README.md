SwiftyStats
===========
SwiftyStats is a generic statistical framework completely written in Swift 4. The framework is basically a port from an existing Objective C framework I've written years ago. The framework includes often used statistical routines. This framework is far from being perfect and is "work in progress".
>Due to some external limitations (earning money) the code will be updated rather sporadically.

# Documentation
A jazzy-generated reference can be found here: [SwiftyStats Doc](http://www.vpedia.net/swiftystats).

**macOS only**:  
Locally you can always generate a docset using the `SwiftyStats/make_doc.sh`script.  
>[Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy) must be present on your system.

```bash
$> cd <CLONE_DIRECTORY>/SwiftyStats
$> ./make_docs.sh
$> open docs/index.html
```

# How to Install
## CocoaPods (recommended if your are on a Mac)
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the preferred way to add SwiftyStats to your project:

```bash
$> cd <YOUR_PROJECT_FOLDER>
$> vi Podfile
```
Your Podfile should looks like this one:  

```ruby
target 'YOURPROJECT' do
  use frameworks!
  pod 'SwiftyStats'  
end
```
Save your edits and execute

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Swift Package Manager (recommended for Linux)

Edit your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
	name: "<YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME>",
	dependencies: [
		.package(url: "https://gitlab.com/strike65/SwiftyStats", from: "0.8.10")
	]
)
```
Then rebuild your project.  
For more information about the Swift Package Manager cick [here](https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager/tree/master/Documentation)

## Manually
* Clone:  

```bash
$> cd <YOUR_FOLDER_FOR_CLONED_REPOS>
$> git clone https://github.com/strike65/SwiftyStats.git
```

Then drag the `SwiftyStats.xcodeproj` into your project and make sure the following build options are set:
### Targeting iOS
- add "SwiftyStats"/"SwiftyStatsMobile" to ```Targets->Build Phases->Target Dependencies```
- add "SwiftyStats"/"SwiftyStatsMobile" to ```Targets->Build Phases->Link Binary With Libraries```
- add "SwiftyStats"/"SwiftyStatsMobile" to ```Targets->Build Phases->Embed Frameworks```

### Targeting macOS
- add "SwiftyStats"/"SwiftyStats" to ```Targets->Build Phases->Target Dependencies```
- add "SwiftyStats"/"SwiftyStats" to ```Targets->Build Phases->Link Binary With Libraries```
- add "SwiftyStats"/"SwiftyStats" to ```Targets->Build Phases->Embed Frameworks```
for macOS targets.

### Targeting Linux
As there is no Xcode-Project, you have to use the Swift Package Manager. See above.

## Build Swift Module from command line

**Clone** the repo to a directory of your choice and change to the directory.  

* `make` or `make debug` builds the module in debug-configuration
* `make release` builds the module in release-configuration
* `make test` builds the module and performs some tests
 * numerical results to compare to are generated using Mathematics / R
* `make clean` resets the build-process

# How to Use
## Accuracy and Precision
Only the **first four decimal places** should be used. For more information about this topic click [here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html).

## Descriptive stats

The central class of the framework is `SSExamine`
`SSExamine` objects encapsulate your data and delivers various statistics. To initialize a new instance follow the steps below.


```swift
import SwiftyStats

// example data
let data: Array<Double> = [3.14,1.21,5.6]
// because our data are double valued items, the parameter "characterSet" is ignored
let test = SSExamine<Double>.init(withObject: data, levelOfMeasurement: .interval, characterSet: nil)
// prints out the arithmetic mean
print("\(test.arithmeticMean)")
// you can use the class to analyze strings too:
let testString = "This string must be analyzed!"
// in this case, only characters contained in CharacterSet.alphanumerics are added
let stringAnalyze = VTExamine<String>(withObject: data, levelOfMeasurement: .nominal, characterSet: CharacterSet.alphanumerics)
print("\(stringAnalyze.frequency("i")")
```
SSExamine objects can be stored and restored in various ways, e.g.:

```swift
do {
	try myExamineObject.archiveTo(filePath: "~/data/myexamine.ssexamine", overwrite: true)
}
catch {
    // error handling
}
...
do {
	newObject: SSExamine<Double> = try SSExamine<Double>.unarchiveFrom(filePath: "~/data/myexamine.ssexamine")
}
catch {
    // error handling
}
```

### Obtainable Statistics
(This list is not exhaustive.)

- sample size
- length (= number of unique elements)
- frequencies (absolute, relative, cumulative)
- empirical cdf
- means (arithmetic, geometric, harmonic, contraharmonic)
- empirical dispersion measures (variance, semi variance, standard deviation, standard error)
- empirical moments (central, about the origin, standardized)
- mode
- maximum, minimum
- quantiles
- entropy based statistics
- ...

## SSHypothesisTesting
The framework implements the following tests so far:

- Kolmogorov Smirnov test (one/two sample))
- Anderson Darling test
- Bartlett test
- Levene test (with variants)
- Grubbs test
- ESD test (Rosner test)
- t test (matched, 2-sample)
- Mann Whitney U-test
- Wilcoxon matched pairs test
- sign test
- one factor ANOVA
- Tukey-Kramer post hoc test
- ScheffÃ©-Test
- basic analysis of cross-tables
- ...


## Probability Distributions
This library provides some of the more common probability distributions. Functions are prefixed by `pdf`, `cdf`, `quantile` for "probability density function", "cumulative density function" and "inverse cumulative density" function respectively. The prefix `para` denotes functions returning a `SSContProbDistParams` struct (fields: `mean`, `variance`, `skewness`, `kurtosis`).  
Probability distributions in general are defined within relatively narrow conditions expressed in terms of certain parameters such as "degree of freedom", "shape" or "mean".  

>**Note:**  
Please always check if `NaN` is returned.
